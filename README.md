# ‚ùÑÔ∏è Drama Comment Tracking and Analysis Project #

This project aims to continuously scrape the latest short comments and user information for the Chinese drama from Douban, store them in a local PostgreSQL database, and later analyze user rating behavior to detect astroturfing activities, build fan profiles, and track public opinion trends.

### üéØ Project Objectives ###
‚è± High-frequency scraping: Scrape the latest Douban short comments every hour starting from the show's release date
üë§ User profiling: Record user IDs and fetch their historical rating activity
üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Astroturfing detection: Analyze patterns in ratings, comment timing, and text to identify fake or coordinated accounts
üìä Trend analysis: Visualize public opinion dynamics, sentiment shifts, and topic heat over time

### üß™ Current Features ###
#### ‚è± Automated Hourly Scraping ####
Automatically scrapes the latest short comments from Douban every hour using a scheduled task.
#### üí¨ Comment & User Data Extraction ####
Collects key fields including comment content, user ID, comment timestamp, and number of likes.

### üóÉ Data Storage in PostgreSQL ###
All collected data is saved into a structured PostgreSQL database for further analysis.
#### üîç User Rating Behavior Tracking (in development) ####
Fetches historical rating records of commenting users to build detailed user profiles.
#### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Astroturfing Detection & Analysis (in development) ####
Uses temporal patterns, user activity, and comment sentiment to identify potential spam or coordinated behavior (a.k.a. "water army").


### üß± Tech Stack ###
* Python ‚Äì Core scraping and data logic (with requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas)
* PostgreSQL ‚Äì Relational database for structured storage
* Airflow (planned) ‚Äì For hourly task scheduling and monitoring
* Jupyter Notebook ‚Äì Used for exploratory data analysis and prototyping
* Metabase ‚Äì For dashboard creation and visualizations locally
* Kafka - Real-time streaming of short reviews; enables batch-wise low-rating detection and trigger actions.
